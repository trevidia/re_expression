Hi Team I need your help with my university project. 

I need your help to create a simple bash script (python script), 
What the script gonna do,  is find  a file in a path find the Date generated (ie: Date generated</td><td> Mon Jul 11 11:44:44 UTC 2022)
and from that date, find all lines with a date less than 30 days, so then copy the entire line all the entire line in a new file with a new name. 
*****************
for example: 
************
Start the file: 
<tr><td>
Date generated</td><td> Mon Jul 11 11:44:44 UTC 2022
</td></tr>
Cert CN=ClientSSL,OU=OUC.UK.MMD_1,O=OUC Uk uni,ST=Manchester,C=GB</td><td> OK: Sun Aug 10 11:09:19 UTC 2022
<tr><td>
Cert CN=Staging SSL CA,O=OUC Uk uni,ST=Manchester,C=GB</td><td> OK: Thu Jul 03 11:10:25 UTC 2110
End the file. 
new file: 
You have the following line
Cert CN=ClientSSL,OU=OUC.UK.MMD_1,O=OUC Uk uni,ST=Manchester,C=GB</td><td> OK: Sun Aug 10 11:09:19 UTC 2022
